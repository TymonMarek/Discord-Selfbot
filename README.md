# Disclamer

Using a selfbot/userbot is highly against Discord's TOS. Do so at your own risk. This is purely for educational purposes only.

# Setup

0. Clone the repository down into a folder.
1. Make sure you have Node.JS and NPM installed.
2. Open a command prompt in the directory of the selfbot.
3. Install packages by typing ```npm install``` in the command prompt.
4. Create a file called ```.env``` in the directory of the selfbot.
5. Inside ```.env```, enter ```TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN-HERE"```, replacing ```YOUR-TOKEN-HERE``` with your Discord account token.
6. Inside ```.env```, enter ```PREFIX=">"``` or replace it to use your own prefix.
7. Run ```node .``` and if no errors occur, you're done. Enjoy!
